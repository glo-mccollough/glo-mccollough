👋 Hi, I’m Glo!
==============

Currently I'm located in Washington State. 

While I am open to freelance and contract to hire possibilities, these opportunities must remain remote as I am looking to relocate in the near future.

- 👀 I’m interested in expanding my current skill set.  Recently certified as a Data Analyst and really digging SQL.
- 🌱 I’m currently taking a deeper dive into SQL and perhaps learning Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with creatives, out of the box thinkers, and amazing product developers.
- 📫 How to reach me glo.lamden.mccollough@gmail.com


My career experience does not define me as a person. It adds to my uniqueness and style. I live each day to learn, collaborate, create something from nothing, teach, lead and follow. ~ Glo
